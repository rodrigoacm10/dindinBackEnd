First, we have the configs folder, which keeps all the configs needed for the application. For example, 
if the app connects to a database, the configuration for the database (like database name and username) 
can be put in a file like db.config.js. Similarly, other configurations like the number of records to 
show on each page for pagination can be saved in a file named general.config.js inside this configs 
folder.
